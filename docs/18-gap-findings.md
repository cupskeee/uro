# 18 — Gap findings (the games as forcing functions)

*The evidence-backed engine backlog, derived from four games built ON Uro (2026-07-12).*

Four games were built as **forcing functions** (`examples/games/`), each aimed at a different
cluster of Uro's deferred / by-policy / unproven work. Each shipped a `GAP_REPORT.md`; this doc
synthesizes them into a prioritized backlog. The point of the exercise: stop *guessing* which
leftover work matters and let real consumers show us, with evidence, where the engine bends. A
finding's weight here is its **cross-game corroboration** — a wall three independent games hit is a
priority; one game's edge case is not.

- **Ironwake** (Chronicler tactics) · **The Sable Court** (realm sim) · **The Seventh Vault**
  (co-op heist, WS) · **Hollowloop** (time-loop roguelike). Full reports in each game folder.

## Landed already (2026-07-12, commit `3d82151` + migration 014)

Confirmed against the code, in-scope, small — fixed immediately:

1. **Fork hot-path `Seq Scan`** (Hollowloop G-10). `_copy_memory` filtered `memory_index` on
   `commit_id`, indexed only on `branch_id` → every fork scanned a *global* table (30–60% of fork
   time, unbounded as the DB grows). **Fixed:** migration 014 adds `memory_index_commit_idx`.
2. **`PartyArbiter` misrotation on holder-disconnect** (Seventh Vault G-17). `note_left` stepped the
   cursor backward when the turn-holder left from a non-zero cursor (double turn / skipped player);
   the existing test masked it. **Fixed:** strict `idx < cur` + wrap, +2 regression tests.
3. **Accepted-but-inert triggers** (Ironwake RL-6, Seventh Vault S7, Hollowloop — *3 games*). A rule
   with an unknown `trigger.event` or a `where` key that isn't a real payload field validated
   silently and never fired. **Fixed:** a `Rule` validator checks event type + where-keys against
   the domain payload models at parse and at `create_world`.
4. **Silent rule-pack death** (Hollowloop G-6). A bad pack was swallowed by the runtime
   exception-isolation → one typo darkened the whole pack. **Fixed:** `create_world` validates the
   pack loudly; the runtime swallow stays a safety net.

## The backlog (ranked by cross-game corroboration)

> **Triage (2026-07-12) — autonomous vs needs-owner-decision.** Working the backlog under a directive
> to clear everything that doesn't need an owner decision. Each item is tagged **[AUTO]** (shape is
> evidence-specified; build + review) or **[DECIDE]** (a genuine fork the owner should pick — flagged,
> not built). **AUTO:** B3 (endpoints enumerated), B4, B5 (API specified in Hollowloop G-5), B6
> *ingestion-receipt half*, and the P3 pure-fixes (loot to_ref liveness, `--token NAME=PARTICIPANT`,
> expose `campaign_pcs`, remove the dead `time_cost` field). **[DECIDE] (flagged below, not built):**
> B2 C3–C6 + computed-delta (owner staged as evidence-gated; OQ-1 defers computed-delta); B6
> *parked-encounter registry* (OQ-12 — waits for a real external game); B7 arbiter shapes (OQ-7 —
> UX/semantics design); B8 cross-fork memory (a never-forked lane — reverses fork semantics); B9
> deterministic planner path (approach choice); B10 session event-sourcing (reverses D-31 "turn state
> is session-only"); rumor statement-distortion (distortion model); branch GC (retention policy);
> pack thread-state vocabularies (grammar latitude); append-time emitter whitelist (repeatedly
> deferred as structural-at-source-suffices; hot-path risk). Dispositions annotated per item below.

### P0 — hit by 3–4 games, clear win

| # | Finding | Games | What Uro needs | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | **`append_beat` doesn't run the Reaction Layer** | **all 4** (Sable G-4, Ironwake, Seventh G-23, Hollow G-12) | ✅ **DONE** — `Engine.append_and_react(campaign, events) -> Commit` (commits + reacts in one exception-isolated call) | Small, unanimous. Was: an embedder who forgot the second `react()` call got silently dead rules. |
| B2 | **The computation / scripting tier (D-33 Stage B)** | **all 4** — Sable Court's **12-rule refusal log** (exact wished syntax) is the headline; Ironwake's 7, Seventh's alarm-meter, Hollowloop's RL-1 corroborate | ✅ **DONE (INC-C1+C2, D-34)** — engine-owned integer counters (`CounterChanged`→`proj_counters`, forking by construction — the shadow-state fix) + threshold/cross-entity-compare/count-edges + `world` scope; phase-end review passed (a counter-RMW concurrency lost-update fixed). WASM reserved at a sharper gate; C3–C6 (for_each/roll_table/expire/cascade) + computed-delta arithmetic staged (`docs/19`). | **The evidence gate we set for Stage B fired.** New argument: refused counters live in game code, so `fork_branch` no longer covers game state — **the two flagship features undermine each other** (Sable G-10, Ironwake row 6) — which is why the fix is *event-sourced* counters, not shadow state. |

### P1 — hit by 2 games, real blocker for a consumer class

| # | Finding | Games | What Uro needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| B3 | **No REST management/read surface** | Ironwake (row 1), Seventh Vault G-15 (10 enumerated 404s) | The docs/08 surface: `POST /worlds`, `/campaigns`, `/campaigns/{c}/join`, `GET /campaigns/{c}/{roster,state,chronicle}`, reads. "The difference between *Uro has a server* and *Uro is a server*." Blocks any non-Python / non-co-located consumer. |
| B4 | **Place-state never reaches the narrator** | Sable Court G-9 (with a recall dump), Hollowloop G-7 | A place channel in `RecallBundle` + the narrator prompt (+ entity-ref claim matching for `p:`/`f:` refs). A game about holdings can't let the narrator see holdings change. |
| B5 | **No cross-branch / aggregate query surface** | Hollowloop G-5 (937 ms to draw 502 loops — the *core UI* of a branching game is its slowest op), Sable Court (fork-compare) | `query_across(branch_ids, projection)` + `diff_branches(a, b)`. Branching is the signature feature; reading across branches is N×round-trips today. |
| B6 | **Chronicler write path returns no receipt / no protected-canon channel** | Ironwake (rows 2–3), Seventh G-22, Sable G-7 | (a) a per-ref ingestion receipt (`applied\|downgraded\|dropped` + reason) from `distill_outcome` + the endpoint; (b) a **parked-encounter registry** — pre-declared cast makes scope checkable *and* gives a trusted game an authorized channel to commit a protected actor's death ("kill the named boss" is currently unwritable). |

### P2 — real, one primary consumer

| # | Finding | Game | What Uro needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| B7 | **Arbiter shapes beyond round-robin** | Seventh Vault S1 (5 concrete shapes) | simultaneous/parallel, proposal-window (`AdmitDecision.QUEUED` is already reserved), consensus/vote, reactive/interrupt, consensual-PvP — all behind the ready `TurnArbiter` port. |
| B8 | **Player-scoped knowledge that survives a fork** | Hollowloop G-1 (the genre-defining need) | A participant-scoped claim lane `fork_branch` doesn't reset (+ optional caller-supplied `ProposedClaim` key, G-2). Every time-loop / roguelike / NG+ consumer reinvents this. |
| B9 | **Deterministic path into the mechanics gate** | Seventh Vault G-1 | The planner is LLM-only; the stub is a no-op, so no check/encounter resolves in the one mode CI can run. A rule-based intent→affordance fallback (or a client-supplied plan). Also: a forced check commits no event and `BeatResult.checks` is a bare count. |
| B10 | **Session lifecycle isn't event-sourced** | Seventh Vault G-18/G-19 | Turn/roster order is lost on reconnect; a late joiner can be seated in state but not authenticated (`--token` is frozen argv). Event-source the ring (or order by PC-binding), + runtime token management. |
| B11 | **`append_and_react` gap's cousins** — `create_thread`/`add_edge` scope is single-dimension | Sable G-3/G-12, Ironwake, Seventh G-6 | A `world` scope + multi-ref scopes (`{factions:[a,b]}`); a dropped-action audit trail (actions silently vanish today). |

### P3 — smaller / documentation / ergonomics

> **[DECIDE] G-3 — beat RNG isn't reproducible across runs** (Seventh Vault G-3; discovered during
> the B4 build to be a **flaky-gate root cause**): `_beat_rng` seeds off the fresh-per-run
> `campaign_id`, so combat outcomes vary run to run (a party test occasionally saw a PC survive a
> guaranteed-loss fight). Proper fix = wire `CampaignStarted.seed` into `_beat_rng` — but that
> changes every pinned combat outcome (meteor / seed-sweep / alien acceptance) and needs a
> derivation choice, so it's its OWN increment, not a small fix. Interim: the affected party test
> was pinned to seed-sweep-proven guaranteed-lose stats so the gate is deterministic.

Item-transfer from a free-roam beat (Ironwake, Seventh G-7, Hollow G-8 — no non-encounter effect
channel) · game↔world **time mapping** + `time_cost` is a dead field + once-per-skip agenda
semantics (all 4) · `AliasAdded` / actor-merge for post-hoc entity repair (Sable G-5) · loot
`to_ref` liveness not checked (Ironwake) · rumor **statement** distortion, not just confidence decay
(Ironwake, "legend grows in the telling") · pack-declared thread-state vocabularies (the closed
`ThreadState` literal blocks a game's own alarm words — Seventh G-5, Hollow G-6) · branch deletion /
GC (Hollowloop G-11) · `--token NAME=PARTICIPANT` + expose `campaign_pcs` in the read surface ·
`tier` capped at 3 vs a brief's `tier 4` (doc mismatch, Sable G-2) · snapshot cadence is depth-from-
genesis so it never fires in a fork-per-loop game (Hollowloop G-4) · append-time emitter whitelist
(the by-policy invariant; Ironwake, Seventh G-27 tripped it deliberately).

## Validated DEFERRALS — what NOT to build (equally valuable)

The games proved several horizon items are **not** needed, killing speculative work:

- **A specialized graph/vector store is NOT justified.** Postgres-as-graph held **flat to 500
  forks** (fork latency O(origin state), not O(branches); Hollowloop measured it). The one real cost
  was a missing index (B-fixed), not the store. *Contra the earlier assumption that scale would force
  a swap.*
- **The `entity_index` (OQ-3) is NOT justified.** Canonical-name + alias resolution held for a court
  of dozens with **0 false merges** (Sable Court), given authored aliases. The cheap missing piece
  is `AliasAdded` for post-hoc repair, not embeddings.
- **The protection ceiling is a *feature*, not a defect.** "The man you killed stands on the
  palisade" was Ironwake's best scene; it emerged *from* the trust model. Keep the blanket ceiling;
  add only an authorized channel (B6) for the "kill the boss" genre.
- **Zero-witness silence, idempotent bundles, the in-process party-race** — all confirmed
  done-and-good. No work needed.
- **NATS distribution** — no consumer is remotely near multi-process scale; still correctly deferred.

## The headline decision: Stage B's evidence gate has fired

D-33 reserved the WASM scripting tier and **defined its trigger**: *"refused until a documented
refusal-log shows authors genuinely need computation the data DSL cannot express."* That log now
exists, four times over — most sharply as Sable Court's 12 wished-for rules in exact pack syntax.
And a stronger argument than we anticipated surfaced independently in two games: because refused
counters fall into game code, they **fall out of `fork_branch`** — so Uro's declarative-rules
feature and its branching feature actively undermine each other through this hole. The question
"should we build Stage B?" is now answerable with data. **Recommended next decision:** scope
engine-owned numeric state / the computation tier (a new decision superseding the D-33 reservation),
using this refusal log as the spec.
